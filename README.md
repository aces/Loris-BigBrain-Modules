# BigBrain Loris Modules

This repository contains the Loris modules which are used to power the Loris instance
contained at http://bigbrain.cbrain.loris.ca. To use them, they should go into the
modules/ directory of a Loris instance.

Most of these modules are simply static content to be displayed to the user, except for
the `bigbrain` module which contains a dynamic slice selector to browse the BigBrain data
set
